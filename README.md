<h1>Tarmac Waiting Times Analysis</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project examines tarmac wait times for passengers at the top ten busiest airports in the U.S. from 2005 to 2015, with a focus on the impact of the 2010 government regulation that fines airlines for excessive tarmac delays. I analyzed data collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to determine whether the rule significantly reduced tarmac times.
